## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

### Prerequisites

1.  A USB drive (16GB or larger).
2.  Familiarity with the official [Dortania's OpenCore Install Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/). This EFI is a supplement, not a replacement for the guide.

### Steps

1.  Download or clone this repository.
2.  **Generate a new SMBIOS:** This is a **CRITICAL** step to avoid conflicts with Apple's services.
    * Download and run the [GenSMBIOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS) script.
    * Use it to generate a new `SMBIOS` for `MacBookPro13,1`.
    * Open `config.plist` and navigate to `PlatformInfo > Generic`.
    * Update the `MLB`, `SystemSerialNumber`, and `SystemUUID` fields with your newly generated values.
3.  Copy the entire `EFI` folder from this repository to the EFI partition of your macOS installer USB.
4.  Follow the Dortania guide to create the bootable USB and perform the macOS installation.
5.  After installation, mount the EFI partition of your main drive and copy the `EFI` folder to it to make the system bootable without the USB.
